According to budget documents released on December 1, Italy intends to [tighten](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-11-30/italy-plans-to-tax-crypto-trading-gains-expand-disclosure) regulations on digital currencies in 2023 by expanding its tax laws to include cryptocurrency trading.


According to Bloomberg, the government intends to [levy](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-11-30/italy-plans-to-tax-crypto-trading-gains-expand-disclosure) a **26% tax on cryptocurrency trading profits exceeding 2,000 euros ($2,062)**. Because digital currencies are considered **"foreign currency"** they have historically had lower tax rates.

If the proposed bill becomes law, taxpayers will be able to declare the value of their digital asset holdings as of **January 1 and pay a 14% tax**. The goal is to encourage Italians to declare their digital assets on their tax returns.

According to Tripe A data, 2.3% of the Italian population or [approximately](https://triple-a.io/crypto-ownership-italy/) 1.3 million people own crypto assest. **By July 2022, it was estimated that approximately 57% of crypto users were male, while 43% were female with the majority of its users falling between the ages of 28 and 38.**

Italy appears to be following in the footsteps of Portugal. Portugal, once known as a cryptocurrency tax haven, proposed a 28% tax on cryptocurrency capital gains in October last year.

The Portuguese government addressed the taxation of cryptocurrencies in its 2023 state budget, which had previously been ignored by tax officials due to the fact that digital assets were not recognised as legal cash.


A **"wide and sufficient"** tax framework will be developed in Portugal with the goal of addressing the taxation and classification of cryptocurrencies. The proposed tax plan includes provisions for capital gains as well as enterprises involving cryptocurrency trading and mining.
