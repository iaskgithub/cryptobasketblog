## Introduction

The advertising market is divided between a handful of global companies whose motives and interests run contrary to our own. When it comes to using these companies’ services, we’re forced to play along with the rules and terms they dictate. In doing so, we’re unknowingly giving away control over our personal data. We believe that users who want to protect their privacy must remain anonymous – and those who’re ready to share their data, deserve a fair reward.
As of today, decentralized systems like blockchain make it easier to maintain confidentiality. A decentralized Web 3.0 protocol, for its part, is a breath of fresh air to online privacy.
