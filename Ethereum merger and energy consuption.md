Ethereum's long-awaited merger, which was completed successfully overnight, was intended to substantially reduce the blockchain network's overall energy consumption—and it appears to have done just that. According to an initial analysis released this morning, Ethereum's energy requirements and carbon footprint have both decreased even more than expected.


The analysis, commissioned by Ethereum-centric software business ConsenSys from the [Crypto Carbon Ratings Institute (CCRI)](https://carbon-ratings.com/), states that Ethereum currently uses 99.99% less energy than before the merger. It also implies that the blockchain's carbon footprint has decreased by more than **99.99%**.

The Ethereum Foundation previously claimed that the merger will reduce the network's energy consumption by 99.95%, citing energy consumption estimates from [Digiconomist](https://digiconomist.net/ethereum-energy-consumption), a site run by famous crypto critic Alex de Vries. This week, [Digiconomist claimed that the true figure would be 99.98%](https://twitter.com/DigiEconomist/status/1569637645508087809).


According to the CCRI research, Ethereum's total electricity use is now only 2,600 megawatt hours per year, down from 23 million megawatt hours prior to the merger. As a result, Ethereum's annual CO2 emissions have been reduced from over 11 million tonnes to just under 870—less than the combined total of 100 ordinary American houses, according to the [EPA](https://www.epa.gov/energy/greenhouse-gas-equivalencies-calculator#results).

Meanwhile, the press statement from ConsenSys described the merger as the **"largest decarbonization in the history of technology."** However, there is one crucial caveat that should be mentioned.

While Ethereum appears to have reduced its environmental effect significantly, many former Ethereum miners—that is, people who used expensive computers to protect the network and earn ETH rewards—have simply gone on to mine money on other networks.


Major Ethereum mining pools, which pool resources from several users, have stated that they will instead mine on the **EthereumPoW (ETHW)** network, which was split from Ethereum's mainnet prior to the merge. It remains to be seen whether ETHW will keep long-term interest, but in the short term, some former Ethereum miners hope to profit in that arena.


Meanwhile, existing blockchain networks such as [Ethereum Classic (ETC)](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum-classic), [Ravencoin (RVN)](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ravencoin), and [Ergo (ERG)](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ergo) have seen increased hash rates following the merger, implying that miners have shifted their strong rigs from one network to another.


In other words, vast amounts of energy are still being expended on cryptocurrency mining, whether for Bitcoin, an Ethereum spinoff, or another coin based on a proof-of-work basis. It's only that it's no longer related to Ethereum, which should help the network shed the environmental worries that will continue to be associated with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.
