## Introduction
Rally is a platform that builds communities around a business or message using content sharing with crypto token rewards. Rally combines concepts from traditional word-of-mouth and influencer marketing with gamification and tactics that have built cryptocurrencies and their communities. This will be the content sharing economy: the next phase in the evolution of the sharing economy, enabled by blockchain and managed by users on their smartphones.


## Features
1. Apply for your own branded cryptocurrencyâ€”no technical knowledge necessary.
2. Encourage fans to become part of your economy, and reward them with coin giveaways.
3. Provide your community with access to private groups and to exclusive content, along with physical and digital goodies when they hold or exchange your coin.
4. Rally takes no fees, has low environmental impact, requires no crypto experience, and seamlessly integrates with your platforms.xs
