## Introduction

Tornado Cash is a fully decentralized non-custodial protocol allowing private transactions in the crypto-space. As a decentralized protocol, Tornado Cash smart contracts have been implemented within the Ethereum blockchain, making them immutable. They can neither be changed nor tampered with. Therefore, nobody - including the original developers - can modify or shut them down. All governance and mining smart contracts are deployed by the community in a decentralized manner.

## Features

1. Tornado Cash smart contracts are unstoppable: there are no admins and no upgradability.
3. The Tornado Cash project does not collect any user data. The UI is hosted in a decentralized way on IPFS.
4. Tornado Cash improves transaction privacy by breaking the on-chain link between source and destination addresses.

## Problems Solved

The Tornado Cash tool allows you to remain anonymous on-chain.
