Despite the billions of dollars it is sucking from the company, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg remains optimistic about the company's Metaverse aspirations, arguing that **"someone needs to construct that."**

When asked if the tech titans' Metaverse play was still viable considering its expense and the doubts placed on the platform during a remote interview at the DealBook Summit in New York on November 30, Zuckerberg responded:

**“I think things look very different on a ten-year time horizon than the zone that we're in for the next few years. I'm still completely optimistic about all the things that we've been optimistic about.”**

“Our kind of operational focus over the next few years is going to be on efficiency and discipline and rigor and kind of just operating in a much tighter environment.”

He added that part of **"seeing things through"** in the long run was "powering through" doubts about the company's ambitions.

Meta's most recent earnings report, released on October 26, revealed the company's largest-ever quarterly loss in Reality Labs, dating back to the fourth quarter of 2020. In 2022, Zuckerberg's virtual reality has cost $9.44 billion, closing in on the more than $10 billion in losses recorded in 2021.


On the earnings call at the time, Zuckerberg was unconcerned about the cost, referring to its metaverse as the "next computing platform," a claim he repeated at DealBook:

**“We're not going to be here in the 2030s communicating and using computing devices that are exactly the same as what we have today, and someone has to build that and invest in it and believe in it.”**

Despite Meta's apparent focus on building its metaverse, Zuckerberg claims that 80% of company investments are directed toward its flagship social media platforms and will remain that way "for quite some time."

He stated that investments in Reality Labs are "less than 20%" at least **"until the Metaverse becomes a larger thing."**

Zuckerberg stated that 40% of the money invested in Reality Labs will go toward Virtual Reality (VR) headsets, with the remaining **"half or more"** going toward what he considers **"the long-term most important form factor. Normal-looking glasses that can put holograms in the world."**


Zuckerberg also slammed its peer tech company Apple for its restrictive App Store policies, which have restricted crypto exchanges and nonfungible token (NFT) marketplaces, saying:

**“I do think Apple has sort of singled themselves out as the only company that is trying to control unilaterally what apps get on a device and I don't think that's a sustainable or good place to be.”**

Other computing platforms, such as Windows and Android, are less restrictive and even allow for other app markets and sideloading — the use of third-party software or apps.

He went on to say that it was Meta's commitment to allow sideloading with its existing VR units and upcoming Augmented Reality (AR) units, and that he hoped future Metaverse platforms would be open in the same way.

**"I believe it is problematic for one company to be able to control what kinds of app experiences are available on the device."**
