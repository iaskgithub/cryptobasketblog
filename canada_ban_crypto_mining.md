According to the Minister, an estimated __17 miners have requested grid connection, with a total energy consumption of 371 MW.__ The Keeyask power plant has been operating at full capacity since earlier this year, and 371 MW is roughly half of its complete capacity.


Hydro-Québec, a provincial utility, asked the province's electrical distribution body earlier this month for a freeze on blockchain-related energy allocations.The government will restrict any new crypto-mining operations from accessing the grid for the next 18 months. __The 37 active mines, on the other hand, will be unaffected.__
