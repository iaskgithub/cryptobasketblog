Before Advocate WK Cheng made his first defense argument, the prosecution outlined their investigation, portraying Pertsev as pivotal to Tornado Cash's operation.

Several use cases and misconceptions about Tornado Cash were highlighted by Cheng. Cheng tried to explain the defense's viewpoints after the preliminary hearing. According to the advocate, the first session has been postponed to Feb. 20, 2023, and that the state has presented a one-sided interpretation of Pertsev's involvement with Tornado Cash.
Cheng also stated that they are going to try to prepare for the next court session and are going to do some requests to some investigations, things that we need to work out to have cleared up.

The prosecution highlighted concerns that Pertsev is a flight risk if he was to be released before the first session despite a raft of promises from his legal team, which would include surveillance in his home and weekly check-ins at the local police station.
