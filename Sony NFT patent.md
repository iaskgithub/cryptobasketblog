According to recently made public records, global entertainment giant Sony submitted a [patent](https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=US378324956) application in 2021 for a system that uses blockchain technology, more particularly NFTs, to monitor digital assets in video games. On November 10, 2022, the patent became public.



The global appeal of gaming and consumer's desire to acquire one-of-a-kind products connected to their favourite celebrities, pastimes, and esports tournament champions are two factors cited by Sony, a Japanese multinational technology company best known for its PlayStation game systems.

**"There is no way to differentiate a specific instance of an in-game item that a famous player of the video game used to win a famous tournament from any other instance of the in-game item in traditional video games"**, Sony says.

Sony intends to use a distributed ledger, or blockchain, to record digital media assets, gameplay, and video clips, as well as include a unique token for the digital item with a unique identifier and metadata that would identify properties of the digital asset, according to the application.


Non-fungible tokens or NFTs, are cryptographically unique tokens that are linked to digital and physical content, proving ownership of items such as artwork, music, memorabilia, and video game items.

While the filing is only for a patent, it demonstrates Sony's interest in the growing NFT gaming market. Axie Infinity, Alien Worlds, STEPN, and The Sandbox are among the top NFT games, also known as Play-to-earn games, according to [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-are-nft-games-top-10-crypto-games).

**"Changes to the digital asset's properties, such as ownership, visual appearance, or metadata, can be identified in a request to update the history"**, Sony explains. **"A new block can be generated and appended to the distributed ledger identifying changes to the digital asset's history."**

While Sony is not the first company to use blockchain technology, it is one of the largest entertainment and media companies to develop plans for incorporating NFTs and blockchain technology into its games.


This would not be Sony's first venture into NFTs. Sony collaborated with Theta Labs to launch a line of 3D NFTs in May 2022. The limited-edition NFT collection is viewable on the Sony Spatial Reality Display tablet-style device.
