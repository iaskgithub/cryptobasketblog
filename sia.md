## Introduction

Sia is a decentralized cloud storage platform that intends to compete with existing storage solutions, at both the P2P and enterprise level. Instead of renting storage from a centralized provider, peers on Sia rent storage from each other. 

No signups, no servers, no trusted third parties. Sia leverages blockchain technology to create a data storage marketplace that is more robust and more affordable than traditional cloud storage providers.

## Features

1. On average, Sia's decentralized cloud storage costs 90% less than incumbent cloud storage providers.
2. Sia encrypts and distributes your files across a decentralized network. You control your private encryption keys and you own your data.
3. vertisers are able to select the ad targets and implement advertisements through analyzing the purchase data on the database.


## Problems Solved

Sia is reinventing cloud storage. Our technology connects users who need file storage with hosts worldwide offering underutilized hard drive capacity. Blockchain technology secures their data and enables improved economics for users and hosts.
