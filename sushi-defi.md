## Introduction

SushiSwap is a decentralized exchange, it is also non-custodial, which means that—unlike centralized exchanges—SushiSwap does not need to possess your tokens in order for you to be able to trade them. Instead, SushiSwap allows users to trade trustlessly, peer-to-peer, with liquidity that is supplied by other users.

## Features

1.  Earn governance rights and 0.05% of all swaps from all chains in one simple place.
2.   Accelerate your project with onsen. Find the best yields anywhere in DeFi hands down.
3. The most competitive rates for DeFi bluechips anywhere. Switch to other chains in one click.
4. Isolated lending markets, elastic interest rates. Leverage long short or create your own market.



## Problems Solved

Sushi is a community-driven organization built to solve what might be called the “liquidity problem.” One could define this problem as the inability of disparate forms of liquidity to connect with markets in a decentralized way, and vice versa. While other solutions provide incrementally progressive advances toward solving the problem of liquidity, Sushi’s progress is intended to create a broader range of network effects. Rather than limiting itself to a single solution, Sushi intertwines many decentralized markets and instruments. Thus far, the core products, which will be described in more detail here, include a decentralized exchange, a decentralized lending market, yield instruments, and staking derivatives.
