In accordance with larger financial markets, cryptocurrency values are staying stable at their highest level since the FTX debacle in early November.

According to [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/), **Bitcoin increased 1.8% over yesterday and was trading at $17,132 at 8:45 a.m. EST. The price of ether increased by 1.5% to $1,285.**


The majority of the gains came following Fed Chair Jerome Powell's speech at the Brookings Institution on Wednesday afternoon, during which he underlined that the rate of interest rate hike may start to decrease this month.

Following the lecture, some altcoins saw similar rallies while others lagged. **Cardano's ADA added 1.4%, Polygon's MATIC increased by 6%, and Binance's BNB increased by 1.2%.**

**Dogecoin lost 0.6% and Ripple's XRP lost 0.9%, respectively.**

**Futures for the Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 both increased, rising 0.43% and 0.55%, respectively. Following the Fed chair's statement on Wednesday, both indices increased.**

According to Nasdaq data, pre-market trading for **Coinbase shares increased by 0.6% to over $46**. The market's favourable response to the Fed's most recent hints helped the cryptocurrency exchange's shares recover after they reached an all-time low last month.

In pre-market trading, Silvergate and Block saw gains of 0.3% and 1%, respectively.

Structured items from Grayscale had a hit and miss day yesterday. Discount to NAV for GBTC increased little, from 42.37% to 42.1%. **ETHE decreased by 0.02% from yesterday to a new all-time low discount of 45.24 %.**
