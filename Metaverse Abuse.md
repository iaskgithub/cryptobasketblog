According to cybersecurity experts, the Metaverse might become a major target next year, in addition to malware, ransomware assaults, and phishing.

On Nov. 28, cybersecurity firm Kaspersky warned of increased abuse of the Metaverse owing to a lack of data protection and moderation standards in its **"Consumer Cyberthreats: Predictions for 2023"** [study](https://securelist.com/consumer-threats-2023/108112/).

Kaspersky admitted that there are presently only a few metaverse platforms, but the number of metaverses is expected to grow in the future years, with the industry reaching [$50 billion by 2026](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/metaverse-market-in-finance-32-of-growth-to-originate-from-north-america-hardware-segment-to-be-significant-for-revenue-generation---technavio-301597053.html). This expansion will attract cyber thieves looking to exploit naïve virtual world members.

**“As the metaverse experience is universal and does not obey regional data protection laws, such as GDPR, this might create complex conflicts between the requirements of the regulations regarding data breach notification.”**

Social media is already a hotspot of data breach activity, so the Metaverse will be an extension of that, [social media was responsible for more than $1 billion in crypto scam-related losses in 2021](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/data-visualizations/data-spotlight/2022/06/reports-show-scammers-cashing-crypto-craze)

Kaspersky also predicted that cyberbullying and sexual assault would spread into Metaverse ecosystems. It listed examples of **"avatar rape and abuse"**, adding that **"this frightening trend is likely to accompany us into 2023"** in the absence of protective systems or moderation standards.

Because of the absence of user protection and privacy issues on its social media platform, Meta, formerly known as Facebook, has already gotten a lot of resistance over its Metaverse goals.

According to Kaspersky, emerging kinds of social media will pose additional hazards. It notably referenced a move to augmented reality-based social media, as well as the possibility of cybercriminals **"distributing bogus trojanized programmes"** to infect smartphones for additional harmful objectives.

The survey determined that the most serious threats to future AR-based social media and metaverse platforms are data and money theft, phishing, and account hacking.
