Brazil has enacted legislation authorizing cryptocurrencies as a form of payment throughout the country, providing a regulatory boost to digital currency acceptance and ecosystem growth. The legislation, issued a document under the code __PL 4401/2021__, that  includes virtual currencies and frequent traveler incentives from airlines in the category of "payment agreements" subjected to supervision by the country's Central Bank.

The bill, which has already been passed, only needs the signature of the __President__ of the Republic to become law, grants legal standing to cryptocurrency payments for goods and services. Brazil has made big progress in cryptocurrency policy and investor adoption. It is now the Latin American country with the most cryptocurrency ETFs.


The bill does not include a clause that would have granted crypto miners tax breaks. Because digital currencies' pseudonymous nature enabled illegal operations, the bill asks for _"tighter monitoring"_ of the industry.
