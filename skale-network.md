## Introduction
SKALE proposes a decentralized, configurable network of on-demand blockchains that supporthigh-throughput, low-cost, and low-latency transactions enabled with storage capabilities and advanced analytics. Additionally, SKALE proposes messaging protocols that enable participants to communicate between these disparate systems. This system aims to provide Ethereum-as-a-Service to developers by providing a gasless subscription-based decentralized network for the provisioning and deployment of high-throughput, EVM-compatible, storage-enabled, provably secure byzantine fault tolerant blockchains.


## Features
1. The SKALE Protocol optimizes the allocation of resources of each node across the entire network of elastic blockchains.
2. Validator Rewards are distributed evenly among nodes. Validators maximize rewards based on meeting performance targets.
3. SKALE is a PoS network that utilizes a work token. Node set up and staking is simple and takes only a few steps.
