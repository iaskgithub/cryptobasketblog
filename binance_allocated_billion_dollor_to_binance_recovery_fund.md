Changpeng "CZ" Zhao, the CEO of Binance, stated on Friday that an additional $2 billion will be set aside for the company's industry recovery fund.

The size increase occurs a day after Changpeng said that Binance is aiming for $1 billion for its crypto recovery fund. Along with other well-known cryptocurrency businesses, Aptos Labs and Jump Crypto joined Binance's effort and will donate $50 million.

Since the beginning of the year, there has been a sharp decline in the cryptocurrency market, which has caused a number of crypto businesses to shut, so the recovery funds will be used to support the industry and buying the troubled assets.
