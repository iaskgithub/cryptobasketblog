## Introduction
Syscoin is a Proof-of-Work blockchain, merged-mined with Bitcoin. At its base it is a dual-layered blockchain: the core is the Syscoin blockchain itself, and running in tandem with it is an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) layer called NEVM (Network-Enhanced Virtual Machine), which provides smart contract functionality.

## Features
1. Build with all of the same EVM tools and resources you already know from the Ethereum platform.
2. Go live on a fast, reliable, and hassle-free network that scales with your application.
3. Design the most ambitious, future-proof projects you can imagine without needing to worry about scalability and inordinate fees.
