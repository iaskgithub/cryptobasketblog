As the collapse of the crypto exchange FTX casts doubt on the industry's centralised players, Telegram is stepping in to create trustless and decentralised alternatives.


On Wednesday, Pavel Durov, the messaging platform's creator and CEO, said in his Telegram channel that the firm would begin developing **"non-custodial wallets"** and **"decentralised exchanges"** that would allow millions of users to safely trade their cryptocurrency.

**"This way, we can right the wrongs caused by excessive centralization, which disappointed hundreds of thousands of cryptocurrency users"**, Durov explained.

According to Durov, the project should be more than doable because the development of Fragment, Telegram's decentralised auction platform, **"took only 5 weeks and 5 people, including myself."**

By selling tokenized usernames on the blockchain, the marketplace, which debuted last month, has already earned **$50 million in Toncoin**. It runs on The Open Network (TON), the spiritual heir to Telegram's previous blockchain ambitions, which were thwarted by the SEC years ago.

Durov, rallying the developer community, advocated for the industry to return to decentralised applications and away from having to rely on third parties. He claimed that reliance on centralised institutions caused many people to lose money in FTX's bankruptcy at the hands of **"a few who began to misuse their position."**


FTX has been [accused](https://twitter.com/brian_armstrong/status/1590088747299008512) of mismanaging customer assets by lending them to its sister trading desk Alameda Research, which is prohibited for exchange firms. Other exchanges are now scrambling to improve their internal checks and balances, such as proof of reserves systems that aim to validate client cash on-chain.

At the Financial Times Crypto and Digital Assets Summit on Wednesday, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson reinforced Durov's point against FTX.

**"The problems we're having aren't protocol failures, they're not DeFi failures"** Hoskinson explained. **"They are failures of trust, failures of regulation, failures of people."**

Crypto users appear to share this sentiment. After FTX declared bankruptcy, JP Morgan analysts noted a **"significant"** drain of funds from other centralised exchanges, including Gemini, OKX, and Crypto.com.

The demise of FTX has also created a crypto contagion that has affected a number of centralised crypto lending organisations. BlockFi has already declared bankruptcy, while other trading desks, like as Genesis, have blocked withdrawals.
