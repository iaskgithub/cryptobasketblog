As the fallout from the **FTX crash** continues to ripple across the sector, crypto executives and lawmakers are becoming more vocal in their requests for regulation of the industry.

In the past 24 hours alone, Maxine Waters, the chair of the US House Financial Services Committee, and Christine Lagarde, the president of the [European Central Bank (ECB)](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/home/html/index.en.html), have both called for regulation and oversight of cryptocurrencies in the European Union as an "absolute necessity."

The bipartisan law Lummis offered this year would have averted the FTX collapse because authorities would be able to determine if an exchange dropped below the threshold **"Immediately"**, she claimed in an interview at the [Financial Times Crypto and Digital Assets Summit](https://www.ft.com/content/7a8e4c6e-f93b-4111-8b03-de8a2e464819).

She said that if those conditions had existed for FTX, they would have raised red flags and prompted regulatory enforcement actions and assessments by federal regulatory bodies.

In the meanwhile, **Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao** stated at a [live on-stage presentation](https://www.binance.com/en/live/video?roomId=2114976) at the University of Nicosia as part of a Binance Meetup Nicosia that he thinks regulation is a means to boost the industry's development, **"protect customers"**, and impose repercussions to anyone found breaching the law.

Similar pro-regulation stance was expressed by [Tom Dunleavy](https://twitter.com/dunleavy89/status/1597233097443102721?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1597233097443102721%7Ctwgr%5Ebd312e610a59ea04b466c8e16797ba79feb17abd%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcointelegraph.com%2Fnews%2Fftx-resumes-employee-and-contractor-payments-after-weeks-in-limbo), a senior research analyst at the crypto analytics company Messari, in a post on Twitter on November 28. He noted that greater regulation of cryptocurrency will open the door **"for large volumes"** of new investors.

The ambiguous regulatory framework, according to Dunleavy, is the main issue for institutional investors when considering a cryptocurrency investment.

The cryptocurrency analyst cited the findings of the Coinbase-sponsored 2022 [Institutional Investor Digital Assets Outlook Survey](https://www.coinbase.com/institutional/research-insights/resources/education/2022-institutional-investor-digital-assets-outlook-survey), which revealed that just over half of respondents who were considering investing in cryptocurrencies were concerned about the unpredictability of the regulatory environment.

Following the collapse of FTX, banking and financial services company JP Morgan stated in a note dated November 24 that it anticipates there will be more urgency in putting in place a uniform structure.

The company claims that laws will probably be adopted from the conventional financial system, **"thereby promoting a convergence of the crypto ecosystem towards the conventional financial system."**
