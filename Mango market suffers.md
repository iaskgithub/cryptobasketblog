Mango Markets was robbed of $100 million in money via an exploit in the second **$100 million** DeFi attack this week. Mango Markets announced Tuesday evening that a hacker was able to drain funds from the company through Oracle pricing manipulation.

Only last Thursday, [**$100 million was stolen from another DeFi technology, Binance Smart Chain**](https://twitter.com/BNBCHAIN/status/1578148078636650496).

According to [OtterSec](https://twitter.com/osec_io/status/1579969930703040513?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1579969930703040513%7Ctwgr%5E96bc8ce19b0dca03974fb288fd03888386eda570%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fdecrypt.co%2F), a blockchain auditing website, the attacker temporarily increased the value of their collateral before borrowing from the Mango treasury.

The attacker then offered 483 million units of MNGO perps (perpetual contracts) on the Mango Markets order book, as Lim said. **The attacker then financed a another account at 6:24 PM ET with 5 million USDC in collateral to purchase those 483 million MNGO perps at $0.03 each.**


The attacker began manipulating the Mango spot market price at 6:26 PM ET, **pushing the price to $0.91 and the 483 million MNGO's worth to $423 million.**

**The attacker then took out a $116 million loan, leaving Mango's treasury with a negative balance of -116.7 million**. Assets drained include USDC, MSOL, SOL, BTC, USDT, SRM, and MNGO, wiping out all of Mango's liquidity.

In response, Mango Markets says it has disabled deposits and is taking steps to have third-party funds frozen.

[A Twitter user noted that the attacker was funded 5.5M from FTX](https://twitter.com/SBF_FTX/status/1579989876321456131?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1579989876321456131%7Ctwgr%5E96bc8ce19b0dca03974fb288fd03888386eda570%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fdecrypt.co%2F), prompting FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried to respond that the company is investigating.

Mango Markets has offered the attacker the chance to collect a bug bounty in exchange for returning the stolen funds.
