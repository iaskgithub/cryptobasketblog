## Introduction

Proton (XPR) is a new public blockchain and smart contract platform designed for both consumer applications and peer-peer payments. It is built around a secure identity and financial settlements layer that allows users to directly link real identity and fiat accounts, pull funds and buy crypto, and use that crypto seamlessly in apps.

Proton is improving and streamlining the verification and speed at which payments are processed either between banks or merchants. Currently for traditional payments, users aren’t asked for consent before a payment is processed, unless going over a comfortable limit, from the credit card processor, and the second layer of authentication is usually an insecure telecom network.



## Features
1. Every business and individual account on Proton has a unique human readable @name. Need to send $20 to @john? It’s as easy as you would expect.
2. Proton chain stores identity attestations by multiple identity providers, both for individuals (KYC) and businesses (KYB). These identity providers can be queried with the user’s permission.
3. Proton supports multiple wrapped stablecoins including USDC, PAX and TUSD. Developers can add their own coins in a permission-free way.
4. We’ve stress-tested Proton at over 40 million transactions per day. It can handle far more traffic than blockchain apps are currently collectively capable of.
