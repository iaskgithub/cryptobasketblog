## Introduction
 Blockchain Validation, NFT Creation, WEB3 & Metaverse, already in use by numerous integrators. It is our mission to help to grow adoption of the VIDT Datalink technology, establishing decentralised governance and supporting data integrity in general. The VIDT Datalink tech is based on a simple & strong formula that adds and protects value at minimum expense and effort.  Using an every cloud to every chain approach, VIDT Datalink already has numerous integrators and publishers using VIDT to secure valuable digital assets like certificates, NFTs, sensor-data, firmware.


## Features
1. In the schedule, publishers are organisations and creators of files, data & (digital) art. The creation of documents or data can be done using services or hardware devices. 
2. These publishers can be linked to any cloud service, which then connects to the VIDT API. The integration of these services is a breeze with VIDT Datalink’s extensive documentation.
3. Only the files’ (encrypted) fingerprints are stored in the blockchain. This ensures privacy and GDPR compliance. Another option for publishers is to connect with the VIDT API directly.
