## Introduction
O3 Swap is a proprietary cross-chain aggregation protocol built by O3 Labs. The mission of O3 Swap is to provide consumers access to cryptocurrency-based, financial services, allowing them to exchange, or ‘swap’, various digital assets within their O3 Wallet. The benefits of this design can be attributed to the high level of safety and security that is inherent to the decentralized model of asset storage and protection. The platform also provides ‘cross-chain’ swaps to conduct exchange settlements without regard to the limitations of a typical isolated Blockchain network.  

## Features
1. Permissionless, Anti-censorship: In any environment, anyone can access O3 Swap without permission and KYC review.
2. Users can exchange assets at the lowest rate and via the most efficient trading route — this is achieved by connecting their own decentralized wallets.
3. Based on the O3 Swap Token's issuance and economic model, decentralized governance and community-driven development will be realized.
4.  We implement all proven and possible cross-chain solutions onto the market with our aggregation protocol.
