This year, the number of decentralized apps on Polygon increased 400% to 37,000. Decentralized applications (DApps) on Polygon, an Ethereum scaling platform, have surpassed 37,000, a 400% rise since the year 2022 began. It also mentioned that at the end of July, there were 11,800 monthly active teams, up a staggering 47.5% from March, which is a gauge of developer engagement on a blockchain. DApp projects are 74% of teams integrated exclusively on Polygon, whereas 26% deployed on both polygon and etherium. More than 142 million unique user addresses and $5 billion in assets have been safeguarded using DApps on Polygon, and the network has currently executed about 1.6 billion transactions. The numbers were released by the Polygon team in a blog post on 10 August 2022 and came from Alchemy, a Web3 development platform that is associated with Polygon. The company noted that the statistic represents the total number of applic ations that have ever been created on both the testnet and mainnet.

The growing number of DApps being developed on the network was mentioned as a major contributing factor earlier this year by the Polygon team. The number of dApps running on the network increased from 3,000 in October to 7,000 in January to over 19,000 as of April, demonstrating its ability to spur adoption. Polygonâ€™s native asset, MATIC, has surged a significant 66.3% in the past month to sit at $0.92 at the time of writing, according to CoinGecko, as the cryptocurrency markets have recently shown signals of a possibly bullish resurgence. MATIC is now the sixteenth largest cryptocurrency asset with a market cap of $6.9 billion.
