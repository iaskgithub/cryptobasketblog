Sber, formerly known as Sberbank the largest bank in Russia is continuing to improve its blockchain platform by merging it with the Ethereum blockchain.

Sber formally [unveiled](https://press.sber.ru/publications/sber-predstavil-novye-vozmozhnosti-svoei-blokchein-platformy) new possibilities for its own blockchain platform on November 30. These included support for Ethereum network applications and smart contracts. According to the bank, this would enable developers to migrate complete projects and smart contracts between Sber's blockchain and open blockchain networks.

The most recent updates to Sber also include an integration with the popular software wallet MetaMask, which is used to communicate with the Ethereum network. According to the statement, the connection enables customers to carry out actions using tokens and smart contracts set up on Sber's blockchain platform.

The head of the blockchain lab at Sber, Alexander Nam, said, **"Sber Blockchain Lab works closely with external developers and partner companies, and I am delighted that our community will be able to operate DeFi applications on Sber's infrastructure."** He said that Sber will be able to bring together developers, businesses, and financial institutions to investigate real-world business uses for blockchain, Web3, and decentralised finance thanks to the newly integrated capabilities.


Shortly after Russian President Vladimir Putin advocated for an open blockchain-based settlement network, Sber made its statement. He challenged the dominance of international financial payment systems and expressed his belief that technology based on digital currencies will lead to banking independence. Putin's administration also forbids the usage of cryptocurrencies by its citizens, outlawing all Bitcoin transactions in early 2020.

Legislators in Russia considered possible legislation changes in late November in order for the country to establish a national cryptocurrency exchange. According to reports, the Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Russia, which are well known for having significant disagreements when it comes to regulating the local crypto market, are both supporting this initiative.
