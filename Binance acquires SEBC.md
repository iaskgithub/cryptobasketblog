In 2017 [SEBC was established](https://www.fsa.go.jp/en/regulated/licensed/index.html) and just last month, the Financial Services Agency of Japan (JFSA) granted it a licence. SEBC provides advisory and brokerage services. BTC/JPY, ETH/JPY, BCH/JPY, XRP/JPY, LTC/JPY, ETC/JPY, XEM/JPY, MONA/JPY, ADA/JPY, XYM/JPY, and COT/JPY are the 11 trading pairs that it currently supports.

Binance enters Japan once again thanks to the agreement. The JFSA filed a second caution against Binance last year, [claiming](https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/notice-regarding-new-user-registrations-in-japan-6026d46a804541ddbfca6cad7d0172aa) that it is still operating illegally in the nation. At the time, Binance declared that it **"does not currently operate any exchanges in Japan, nor do we aggressively seek out Japanese users."**

**"A major factor in the acceptance of cryptocurrencies in the future will be the Japanese market "**,The remark was made by Takeshi Chino, general manager of Binance Japan. **"It is already ready for significant blockchain adoption because it has one of the most developed tech ecosystems and one of the largest economies in the world. We will actively collaborate with regulators to create our combined exchange for local users in a compliant manner. We are enthusiastic to assist Japan in becoming a global leader in crypto.**
