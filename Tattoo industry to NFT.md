Tattoos have been a global phenomenon for thousands of years, surviving cultural transformations and technological shifts. As the art evolves, it has now entered the nonfungible token (NFT) space in order to remain relevant in an increasingly digital world.

Keith McCurdy, also known as Bang Bang in the tattoo industry, is one of the artists hoping to combine the ethos of tattoo culture with disruptive technologies. He's using a new type of rewriteable tattoo ink that appears and fades depending on the lighting.

According to Bang Bang, researchers at the University of Colorado have been working on a tattoo ink made of photochromic microcapsules for the past five years. This technology, known as "tech tattoos," leaves a color-changing mark that is activated by UV light, changing the tattooed image as it does so. He views the technology as a means of bridging the NFTs' undeniable distinctiveness with the tattoo culture's demand for individuality. He sold the first rewritable tattoo as a 1/1 NFT back in June for 100 ether (ETH), which was equivalent to around $100,000 at the time.

Indelible is a firm that is trying to connect the tattoo community to Web3. It gives owners the opportunity to utilise their intellectual property rights by creating new tattoos and adding these to pre-existing profile image (PFP) NFTs.

The firm was founded eight months ago with the notion that tattoo artists should be able to market their services outside of their studios and have access to an infinite number of methods to earn money from their work. "We thought that was a really unique use of tattoo culture, and we wanted to approach it the other way, which would include tattooing actual people with actual characters. We want to ink Web3."

Verified Market Research (VMR) projects that the NFT market will reach a value of $231 billion by 2030. The industry is anticipated to expand at 33.7% compound annual rate during the following eight years. Among the numerous fields where NFTs are in high demand are the arts, entertainment, and sports.
