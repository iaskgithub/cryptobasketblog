## Introduction
Venus Protocol is an algorithmic-based money market system designed to bring a complete decentralized finance-based lending and credit system onto Binance Smart Chain. Venus enables users to utilize their cryptocurrencies by supplying collateral to the network that may be borrowed by pledging over-collateralized cryptocurrencies. This creates a secure lending environment where the lender receives a compounded interest rate annually (APY) paid per block, while the borrower pays interest on the cryptocurrency borrowed.

## Features
1. Access an immutable money market directly on-chain.
2. All Venus Protocol assets are bound by the BEP-20 standard.
3. Built on BNB Chain for fast, secure, and low cost transactions.
