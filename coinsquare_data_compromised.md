One of the biggest cryptocurrency exchanges in Canada, Coinsquare, may have had a hack, but the business insists that customer assets are "safe in cold storage and are not at danger."

Customers were notified via email yesterday of a "data incident" in which an unauthorised third party gained access to a client database including personal information. The email stated "No passwords were exposed. We have no evidence any of this information was viewed by the bad actor”.

According to the email, the breach revealed "customer names, email addresses, home addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth, device IDs, public wallet addresses, transaction histories, and account balances." Despite the fact that the email was issued yesterday, Coinsquare detected the hack last week and warned clients through Twitter.

After discovering the flaw last week, Coinsquare stopped all activity on its platform, sparking worry about potential liquidity problems in light of the historic collapse of the multi-billion dollar cryptocurrency exchange FTX this month. 

The firm tweeted, "We want to reiterate that 100% of client funds are safely held in cold storage and are not used for business activities"
