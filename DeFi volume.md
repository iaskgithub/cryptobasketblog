According to a recent Chainalysis research, the U.S. has experienced the largest decline in Bitcoin supremacy among all other countries.


The U.S. suffered a 6% decline in market share for the largest cryptocurrency in the world by market capitalization between July 2021 and June 2022, largely due to the fact that there was more DeFi activity there than anywhere else. According to DeFi Llama, the DeFi ecosystem has $53 billion worth of assets locked in several protocols as of Thursday morning. Since the year began, the sector has lost more than $100 billion.

Nevertheless, 37% of all DeFi activity examined by Chainalysis originated in the United States, with 31% coming from Western Europe. Decentralized exchanges, also known as DEXes, receive the majority of value under the DeFi umbrella and are typically employed by institutional and professional investors. However, NFTs are the category's top producer of web traffic. It's evidence that NFTs have primarily attracted mainstream customers to DeFi, the paper claims. 


It's also not the sole indication. A Reddit executive claimed earlier this week that the Collectible Avatars NFT series of the company had brought in more than 3 million new Web3 users.


The U.S. contributed for more than $1 trillion in total crypto transaction volumes over the past year, second only to Western Europe in terms of DeFi and other crypto transactions. According to the Chainalysis research, that indicates that in the previous year, U.S. investors were involved in one out of every five cryptocurrency transactions.


According to Matt Van Buskirk, co-founder and CEO of crypto compliance startup Hummingbird, current market weakness appears to have concentrated project teams on greatly alleviating financial pain points, like mortgages, identity verification, and the tokenization of physical assets.


Due to their rich talent pools of engineers and researchers, the U.S. and Western Europe have an advantage over other regions in this regard.
