## Introduction

Poriverse is the first NFT game to allow players to lend and trade NFT to earn more, thus opening a new chapter for the NFT game industry. Now with NFT renting technology, the cost of entry has been lowered for not only experienced crypto gamers and NFT holders who want to diversify their portfolio but also newcomers in the P2E arena. The market is now unlimited to users and investors.
Poriverse originated with a special NFT system of Porian pieces and classes, which allows gamers to purchase or strategically grow their own Porian NFTs. Fair winning opportunities among players are designed through unique Porians rented randomly for higher-value Porian breeding.
