## Introduction
It is a spell book that allows users to produce magic money on the the internet. You, the Spellcaster, can provide collateral in the form of various interest bearing crypto assets such as yvYFI, yvUSDT, yvUSDC, xSUSHI and more. With this, you can borrow magic internet money (MIM) which is a stable coin that you can swap for any other traditional stable coin.


## Features
1. The formula is straight forward. collateral in - poof - stable coin out.
2. To reverse the spell, the caster simply returns the conjured mims to the spell book. then the magically locked interest bearing tokens are released.
