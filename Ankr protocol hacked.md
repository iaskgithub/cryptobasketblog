There has been a significant Ankr Protocol exploit, albeit there aren't many specifics available at the present. The development team disclosed that its aBNB coin has been misused on December 2. Additionally, it stated that it was coordinating with exchanges to suspend trade.


All underlying assets on Ankr Staking are now safe, according to Ankr, and all infrastructure services are unaffected.

The BNB Chain ecosystem's web3 infrastructure supplier is Ankr. It is a platform for cloud computing that shares surplus processing resources. You may mine its native ANKR cryptocurrency by lending the network your processing power. On **BEP-20 tokens**, it also provides a selection of staking and yield-earning possibilities.

The limitless mint flaw was found in the aBNBc token's smart contract, according to blockchain security company PeckShield.

Additionally, it [stated](https://twitter.com/PeckShieldAlert/status/1598500528295534592) that **900 BNB worth around $253,000 had been moved into Tornado Cash by the Ankr exploiter**. The addition that the exploiter presently controls **500,000 USDC and 3,000 ETH (about $3.8 million)** indicates that it had also crossed USDC and ETH to Ethereum.

The hacker has amassed **20 trillion aBNBc and is now the token's 13th-largest holder**. Ankr Reward Bearing Staked BNB is another name for the staking reward token known as aBNBc

Although the damages haven't been completely recognised, they are probably in the millions of dollars. According to early estimations, hackers won $5 million by washing tokens over several bridges and DEXes.


According to [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ankr-network), the same-named native token of Ankr only lost 6.6% at the time of the hack. **ANKR dropped to $0.0211 but managed to rise back up to $0.0213 at the time of writing. From its all-time high of $0.213 in April 2021, the token has already dropped by 90%**.

The Binance BNB coin fell to $288, a 3.1% daily decline. However, given that most digital assets are already losing value, this is consistent with a larger collapse in the cryptocurrency market today.
