## Introduction
PARSIQ is a Web3 data platform that helps build functionality on top of blockchain data. With Smart Triggers, you can create “if-this-then-that” workflows – watch for a specific on-chain event and initiate downstream actions when they occur. Our Trigger Wizard is our no-code editor that helps you create Smart Triggers for the most common use cases in just minutes.

## Features
1. Deliver real-time alerts to your users when relevant activities occur. 
2. Build capabilities on top of blockchain data without writing custom code. 
3. Instantly detect risky transactions and blacklisted accounts.
