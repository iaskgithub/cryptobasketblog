The influencer criticized Bankman-Fried after FTX, previously the third-largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world, just went down, causing a crypto crash. In the wake of FTX's bankruptcy, he also blasted the celebrities who pushed the firm. 


The influencer is adamant that he must speak with SBF in order to hear what he has to say on the FTX predicament. Additionally, he asks SBF to unblock him on Twitter.

He explained, "I'm simply down here because nobody has been ready to stand up for the people and face Sam. BitBoy went at One cable beach investigating Barbara Fried and Joe Bankmans real estate portfolio.

Regulators and the mainstream media have been under fire from the cryptocurrency community for failing to take action against SBF, who has caused billions of dollars in losses for retail clients. People have also brought up SBF's massive political contributions only days before to the start of the FTX disaster as a reason why authorities could be reluctant to take a tough stance.
